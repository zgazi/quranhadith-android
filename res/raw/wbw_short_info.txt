mūsā
Musa,

And We shaded

ʿalayhimu

yaẓlimūna
doing wrong.
(7:161:1)
wa-idh
And when
(7:161:2)
qīla
it was said

lahumu
to them,

We will increase (reward)

(7:162:1)
fabaddala
But changed

Thus

nablūhum
We test them

they were

(7:164:1)
wa-idh
And when
(7:164:2)
qālat
said

a community

min'hum
among them,
(7:164:5)

They said,

(7:165:1)
falammā
So when

they forgot

dhukkirū
they had been reminded
(7:165:5)

We saved

So when

And when

declared

Indeed,

your Lord

raḥīmun
Most Merciful.
(7:168:1)
waqaṭṭaʿnāhum
And We divided them

Said

He said,
